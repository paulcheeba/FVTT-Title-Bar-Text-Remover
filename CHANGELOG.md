### Changed
 
### Fixed

## [v 0.1.0 Initial release] - 2021-08-02
 
Combined Turals module that copies the links text string, converts it to a title so it will display on hover and removes the link. Some other modules were loading after this one causing their links to retain their Text values. I was able to hide the remaining text with u/Mejari's suggestion of changiing the font to 0 via CSS.
 
### Added
- [v 0.1.0 Initial release]: Added CSS to the module.
